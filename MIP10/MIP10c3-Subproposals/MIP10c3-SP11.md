### Summary

PAXG which represents a tokenized version of gold represents the first potential instance of a real-world asset in the Maker Protocol. Real-world assets aid in stabilizing Dai by diversifying the collateral portfolio with non-correlated assets. Gold in particular has historically been inversely-correlated to equities / crypto in times of financial stress. 

The currently supply and daily trading volume of PAXG is quite small. Although, it won't provide a significant diversification benefit in the immediate future, it has the potential to grow. Meanwhile it serves as an important symbol of the future evolution of the Maker Protocol.

The recent listings of PAXG on Binance and Gemini have enabled the creation of a secure and reliable Oracle for PAXG. There is a healthy distribution of USD, USDT, and ETH pairs such that no single quote can on its own impact the canonical price. The Oracle Domain Team will keep a close eye on the development of the liquidity profile of PAXG over time such that the Oracle Data Model accurately reflects the reality of the market.
