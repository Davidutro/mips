* The idea behind these Happiness Airdrops is to identify, acquire, and engage new and existing community members through a unique outreach approach.

### Team Credentials

#### Andrew Burban

Andrew Burban is a professional shitposter, memer, insomniac, and degen. He currently has no clue what he is doing but seems to be pretty good at it. He tends to be pretty good with people and somehow is able to elicit a laugh from many of them. He can be too much for some people at first, but eventually, to his bewilderment, they grow to like him.

His first introduction to crypto was a crash course on Ponzis, stealing all his BTC and resetting him to zero *(see: [The Gelfman Blueprint](https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/7831-18))*. Later, he rode the 2017 bubble to life-changing riches before losing it all again, chasing ICOs, FOMOing into shitcoins, and catching falling knives buying "the dip" as the bear market began. He believed in the tech... and he knew Bitcoin was going to $40k! HODL! He was surprised to learn that number does not only go up.

Andrew has been with Maker since mid-2015, and, to his credit, MKR has been the one position he has never sold and likely never will. He has been involved in Community-Development for several years, introducing dozens of new people to the space. Recently, he has become more involved in governance and the Maker Community as a whole.
