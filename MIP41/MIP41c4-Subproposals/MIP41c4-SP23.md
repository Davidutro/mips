## Sentence Summary

This subproposal adds Tomek Mierzwa (@tmierzwa) as the facilitator for the Data Insights Core Unit.

## Specification

### Motivation

My name is Tomek Mierzwa. 

I have over 20 years of experience with data engineering, data quality management, data governance and business intelligence.

For almost two years I’ve been leading the Data Services team in the Foundation. I had a pleasure to work with many of you, providing information and insights, answering questions and building data related products. With the help and inspiration of many people I created the EthTx.info transaction decoder as well as the MCDState, MCDGov and Liq2.0 datasets.

Currently, after leaving the Foundation I’m involved in building Token Flow, a venture dedicated to monetizing blockchain data inside and outside the DeFi ecosystem. I believe I’m well suited to become a part-time Facilitator of the Data Insights CU and serve MakerDAO with my experience with data and the Protocol.
